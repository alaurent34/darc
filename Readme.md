# DARC - Data Anonymisation and Re-indentification Competition

This Repository contains all source code for PETS Competition DARC. More
specifically it contains :
  - Source code for the re-identification metrics.
  - Source code for the utility metric.
  - Source code for succes in re-identification.

What need to be done :
  1. Create a script to sample the data from UCI.
  2. Document source code available
  3. Translate japaneese comments in source code
  4. *Any suggestion goes here*

## Datasets

### Source
Original dataset is from UCI and can be downloaded
[here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail).

### Description

**Original** :
This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring
between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online
retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the
company are wholesalers. [1](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail)

**PWSCup** :
The dataset is separated in two distinct datasets, one which contain all `n`
clients (`M`) and the other containing all transactions made by those `n`
clients during one year (`T`).

## Notations

You can find in the table beloe all the notation used in the scripts and this
Readme.

  There is 6 re-indentification metrics, which are :
  <table class="tg">
    <tr>
      <th class="tg-us36">Notations</th>
      <th class="tg-us36">Meaning</th>
    </tr>

### Success metrics

# List of programs

Here we discuss of the purpose of the differents scripts found in [PWSCup 2017
archive](https://pwscup.personal-data.biz/web/pws2017/data/PWSCUP2017_Samples.zip).

We will not represent here scripts for Utility and Metrics as we already list
them above.

## To sort

This is the current list of script to sort. Please update this list once the
script is sorted. Programs can be found under ADD PATH HERE.

### Python

 - common.py
 - tool-kamei.py
 - tool-kameimap.py
 - tool-divide.py

### Ruby

 - tool-eval-re-tcm.rb
 - tool-map.rb
 - tool-ncat.rb
 - tool-nsplit.rb
 - tool-r2cid.rb

### R

Just some re-identification code

### Feelings

For now i have the feeling that we can only use python scripts for our needs.

## Sorted

This is a list of script sorted by categories and with an explaination of what
it does.

Thanks to respect the format when placing a script here.

>  TODO: Mettre le format a respecter  <17-04-18, Antoine> >

### Create S From AT
This script take AT, the player anonymised database and create the file S with
'DEL' entry supress and line shuffled:

 - tool-createPBdata.py

### Concat file between them

There is two scripts for doing so which are :

 - tool-ncat.py
 - tool-ncat.rb

They are usualy used to concat M, A and AT and return a J file

### Scoring
For scoring mesure there is multiples files :
 - Scripts for utility and security measure (Ei and Si)

Those to compare F and F_hat:
 - tool-compare_and.py
 - tool-mapcompare.py

>  TODO: comprendre ce qu'il fait <25-04-18, Antoine> >
And this one (to be determined)
 - tool-mcompare.py
